# pytest-autolog
This pytest plugin allows users to automatically create/capture test log information.  With this plugin, users can generate more detailed test logs than pytest provides by default (eg. allows users to include test metadata in results logs).  Also, this plugin allows users to centralize test logging code in one location (which reduces duplication in test repositories).
